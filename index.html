<p>ES Learn Spanish Words is a free Spanish learning app. It offers a different approach to learning Spanish and building a vocabulary. It consists of two stages of learning:</p>

<p>• Browse websites in Spanish. Read the news or whatever may catch your interest. Touch any word you don't understand and read the translation in the bottom part of the screen. If you wish, you may add the word to your word list.</p>
<p>• Practice your word list using flashcards. The flashcards consist of various quizzes: First, a multiple choice quiz. Then a quiz where the initial letter of the word must be touched. After that, a hangman style quiz. And finally, the word must be spelled out to be considered fully learned. When a word is fully learned, the estimated date of reaching the next milestone is shown. The first milestone is 10 words, then 100, 500, 1000 words and so on.</p>

<p>If a verb is added to your word list, a quiz will appear that allows you to practice the verb conjugations.</p>

<p>You may also practice the pronunciation of the words and sentences you add. The app will test your spoken Spanish and if you pronounce the word or sentence in an acceptable way, a reward is granted.
(The app will ask for permission to record audio. This permission is used to enable speech recognition.)</p>

<p>The app also includes a hands-free mode using the built in speech synthesis, that enables you to practice your words while driving, while working out, or whenever you feel like it.</p>

<p>Your personal word list may be organized by adding tags to the words. Pictures and example texts may also be added to a word. Selected words may be shared with friends or exported to Google Drive as a CSV file or as internal file format.</p>

<p>The app does not contain ads, but it links to external web pages that may or may not contain ads.</p>

<p>Please note: This app is probably not for the absolute beginner.</p>
<p>The app was previously called "Spanish Vocabulary Surfer"</p>
